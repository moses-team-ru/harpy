# Contributing to Harpy

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Harpy as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/harpy/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/harpy/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use `dart format` to format your code
* Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add documentation comments for public APIs

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/harpy.git
   cd harpy
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   dart test
   ```

4. Run the example:
   ```bash
   cd example
   dart pub get
   dart run main.dart
   ```
