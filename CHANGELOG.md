# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.1+4] - 2025-10-03

### Changed
- **Project Structure Refactoring**: Generated projects now use `lib/main.dart` instead of `bin/main.dart` for the main application
  - Main application code now resides in `lib/` following Dart conventions
  - Improves testability and code organization
  - Allows for better code reuse and modularization

### Added
- **CLI Management Tool**: Each generated project now includes a CLI utility in `bin/<project_name>.dart`
  - `serve` command - Starts the development server
  - `migrate` command - Placeholder for database migrations (ready for implementation)
  - `version` command - Shows project and framework version
  - `help` command - Displays available commands and usage
- Enhanced project scaffolding with improved documentation
- Updated README templates for generated projects with CLI usage examples
- Better output messages after project creation showing project structure and available commands

### Technical Details
- CLI utility supports extensibility - developers can add custom commands
- Local project management without global installation conflicts
- Cleaner separation between application logic (`lib/`) and management tools (`bin/`)

### Migration Guide
For existing projects created with earlier versions:
1. Move `bin/main.dart` to `lib/main.dart`
2. Optionally create a CLI utility in `bin/<your_project>.dart` (see template in new projects)
3. Update your IDE run configurations if needed

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-25

### Added
- Initial release of Harpy framework
- Basic HTTP server functionality
- RESTful routing
- Middleware system

### Known Limitations
- **Redis Adapter** - Currently implemented as stub for demonstration purposes
- **Model Relationships** - Basic implementation, advanced relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many) planned for future releases
- **Query Builder Joins** - Basic join support, complex join operations under development
- **Schema Migrations** - Manual rollback required, automatic rollback planned

### Planned Features (Future Releases)  
- **Complete Redis Implementation** - Full Redis client integration with all data types
- **Advanced ORM Features** - Model relationships, lazy loading, eager loading
- **Query Optimization** - Query caching, performance monitoring, query hints
- **Additional Database Adapters** - CouchDB, InfluxDB, Neo4j support
- **Enhanced Security** - Row-level security, audit logging, encryption at rest
- **Performance Improvements** - Connection pool optimization, query result caching

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Over 100 tests covering all ORM functionality  
- **Database Adapter Tests** - Individual test suites for each database adapter
- **Integration Tests** - Full request-response cycle testing with database operations
- **Performance Tests** - Connection pooling, query performance, and memory usage validation
- **Security Tests** - SQL injection prevention and input validation testing
- **Migration Tests** - Schema creation, modification, and rollback validation

### Performance Benchmarks
- **SQLite Operations** - 10,000+ inserts/second in single transaction
- **PostgreSQL Connections** - Efficient connection pooling with configurable pool sizes
- **MySQL Compatibility** - Full compatibility with MySQL 5.7+ and MariaDB 10.3+
- **MongoDB Performance** - Optimized document operations with aggregation pipeline support
- **Memory Usage** - Efficient model attribute management with minimal memory overhead
- **Transaction Performance** - ACID compliance with minimal performance impact

### Breaking Changes
- None in this initial release

### Fixed
- **Deprecated Function** - Replaced `getUpdatedRows()` with `updatedRows` in SQLite adapter for compatibility with sqlite3 ^2.9.0
- **Router 404 Bug** - Fixed critical bug where all routes returned 404 errors. The router was using `request.url.path` which returns paths without leading slash (e.g., `""` for `/`, `"test"` for `/test`), while regex patterns expected paths with leading slash (e.g., `^/$`, `^/test$`). Changed to use `request.requestedUri.path` and added path normalization for trailing slashes. Added 30 comprehensive routing tests (14 integration tests + 16 edge case tests) to prevent regressions.
